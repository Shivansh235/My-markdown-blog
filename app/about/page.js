                  Hello, I am Shivansh Kasaudhan, a second-year B.Tech student
                  at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT)
                  Ranchi, specializing in Electronics and Communication
                  Engineering (ECE).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am deeply passionate about coding and programming. Over
                  time, I have honed my skills and currently work as a
                  full-stack developer specializing in the MERN stack.
                  Additionally, I have proficiency in programming languages such
                  as C, C++, and Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My ultimate goal is to evolve into a highly skilled developer,
                  whether in web, app, or game development. I am committed to
                  continuous learning and self-improvement, ensuring that by the
                  end of my B.Tech journey, I will have established myself as an
                  expert in my field.
                  Let us explore the world of coding together!

                  The Spark of Curiosity
                </h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-50">
                My coding journey began in my first year of college, driven by my curiosity to build websites, apps, and solve coding problems. However, my true developer journey started in my second year when I delved into web development and began building projects. Along the way, I encountered numerous challenges, but I made a promise to myselfâ€”to become a full-stack developer. This motivation fuels my determination and gives me the courage to keep pushing forward.

                </h3>
                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-50">
                As I dive deeper into the world of development, I have mastered various technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Beyond web development, I am eager to explore mobile app development and deepen my knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to enhance my problem-solving skills.

                <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-50">
                Sometimes, the journey felt overwhelming. There were moments when I doubted myself, feeling like I was forgetting what I had learned or struggling to implement concepts. For instance, when I first encountered React hooks, I was baffled and unsure how to use them effectively. But I persevered, kept learning, and practiced consistently. Over time, I became comfortable using hooks in my projects. This journey has taught me that hard work and persistence always pay off, and every challenge is an opportunity to grow.
