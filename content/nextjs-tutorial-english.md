## 1. Introduction
Next.js is a popular framework for React.js that makes server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) easy. It helps developers build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications.

## 2. Why Use Next.js?
### 2.1. SEO Friendly
Next.js supports server-side rendering and static site generation, making websites more SEO-friendly.

### 2.2. High Performance
Next.js provides caching and image optimization features, ensuring fast-loading web apps.

### 2.3. Automatic Code Splitting
Next.js loads only the required JavaScript, improving page performance.

## 3. Installing Next.js
### 3.1. Project Setup
To get started with Next.js, install Node.js and run the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```
Your Next.js app will now run at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 4. Key Features of Next.js
### 4.1. File-Based Routing
Next.js uses a file-system-based routing system. You can create a new page by adding a `.js` or `.tsx` file in the `pages` folder.
```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```

### 4.2. API Routes
Next.js also allows you to create backend APIs inside the `pages/api` folder.
```js
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js API' });
}
```

### 4.3. Image Optimization
Next.js provides built-in image optimization using `next/image`.
```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';
function MyImage() {
  return <Image src='/myimage.jpg' width={500} height={300} alt='My Image' />;
}
export default MyImage;
```

## 5. Deployment
Next.js projects can be easily deployed on Vercel.
```sh
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Conclusion
Next.js is a powerful framework that enhances React.js. If you want to build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications, learning Next.js is a great choice.
