## 1. Introduction
Next.js and React.js are widely used for web development. React.js is a UI library for building components, while Next.js is a framework built on top of React that enhances performance and SEO. This blog will compare their features, capabilities, and ideal use cases.

## 2. What Are Next.js and React.js?
### 2.1. React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.

### 2.2. Next.js
Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other optimizations to improve performance and SEO.

## 3. Key Differences
### 3.1. Performance
- **React.js:** Renders content on the client side, which can lead to slower initial page loads.
- **Next.js:** Supports SSR and SSG, leading to faster load times and better SEO.

### 3.2. Use Cases
- **React.js:** Ideal for SPAs (Single Page Applications) and dynamic UIs.
- **Next.js:** Best for static sites, SEO-driven applications, and fast-loading pages.

### 3.3. Routing
- **React.js:** Uses client-side routing with libraries like React Router.
- **Next.js:** Provides built-in file-based routing, making navigation easier.

## 4. How to Use Next.js and React.js
### 4.1. Installing React.js
You can set up a React project using Create React App:
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

### 4.2. Installing Next.js
To create a Next.js project, use:
```sh
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

## 5. Which One Should You Choose?
If you need a flexible UI library, React.js is a great choice. If you want performance, SEO benefits, and a structured framework, Next.js is better.

## Conclusion
Both Next.js and React.js have their strengths. React.js is perfect for UI development, while Next.js enhances performance and SEO. The choice depends on your project needs.
